    When you have done the required changes, copy the the code (the applicable parts of it) to Ville "coding area" and submit it. Ville system will check its correctness. 

### Commit your work to git repo

- Commit (and push) your changes to your Git repository.


### Why all this? (The rationale)

- We will be using Ville to do some coding exercises during the course - AND in the exam
- VSCode + git is a professional environment for SW development

So, you need the handle the both environments.
