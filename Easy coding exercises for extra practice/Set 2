1. Copy an array of numbers from the internet and code that e.g. prints out the numbers. 

2. Edit the code of #1, e.g. edit the number range, print every other element, print every third element, 
print numbers from largest to smallest and from smallest to largest 

3. Do some of the tasks of #1 and #2 using both for and while loops, also try do-while.

4. Calculate the sum and average of integers less than a hundred or a thousand. 
Start by calculating the sum and average of integers less than ten so it is easy to verify you code works correctly.

5. Calculate the sum and average of integers less than a hundred (or thousand) that are divisible by three and five. 

6. Print out a half pyramid, e.g. with letters (or numbers), start with the same character and then try the example below:
