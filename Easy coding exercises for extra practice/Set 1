For tasks 1–5, do each of the following:
•	First, use a hardcoded number.
•	Then, use a number entered by the user.
•	Finally, use a randomly generated number.
•	You may use functions if you wish (especially if the tasks are otherwise easy).

1. Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero. Format the output like this:
        For example, with number 7: Number 7 is positive.
        For example, with number -3: Number -3 is negative.
2. Check if a number is even or odd (remember the % operator).
3. Check if a number is divisible by 3.
4. Check if a number is divisible by 5.
5. Check if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
6. Hardcode a few numbers into an array. 
7. Print the numbers from that array in order. Then print them in reverse order. Use for-loop. Also try while-loop.
8. Then print e.g. every second number. 
9. Change some numbers and print the new ones.
