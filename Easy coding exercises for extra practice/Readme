The point of these exercise sets is to increase your coding routines. The point is not to ask AI to do them for you. 
Try first if you can solve the exercise without AI by just using some C coding tutorial and lecture slides.

If you cannot do the some of the exercises, skip them and move on. Return to the tricky ones a bit later. 
And feel free to ask AI for help, as long as you do the coding, not AI.

There are no points available for doing these, but the aim is to give you something relatively easy to code and practice.
No need to return anything, but feel free to submit the exercises to your Git (e.g. create a new folder for these).
